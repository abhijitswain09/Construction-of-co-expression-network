# Co-Expression Network Construction Repository

Welcome to the Co-Expression Network Construction repository! This repository contains the scripts and documentation for constructing co-expression networks from gene expression data. Co-expression networks provide valuable insights into the relationships between genes and can help identify functionally related gene modules.

## Introduction

Co-expression networks are networks where nodes represent genes, and edges represent co-expression relationships between genes. These networks are constructed from gene expression data, typically using correlation or mutual information measures to quantify the strength of co-expression.

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for constructing co-expression networks from gene expression data and includes preprocessing steps, network construction, and visualization.

## Dependencies

Before running the network construction pipeline, make sure you have the following tools and software installed on your system:

- R (version x.x.x): A programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- Bioconductor (version x.x.x): A collection of R packages for bioinformatics data analysis.
- WGCNA (version x.x.x): An R package for weighted correlation network analysis.

Make sure to update the versions with the appropriate ones you are using.

## Data

The gene expression data used in this analysis is not included in this repository. Please ensure you have access to the data and place it in the appropriate input directory before running the pipeline.

## Network Construction Workflow

The network construction pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the gene expression data, including normalization and handling missing values.
2. **Co-Expression Measure Calculation**: Calculate the co-expression measure (e.g., correlation or mutual information) between gene pairs.
3. **Network Construction**: Construct the co-expression network by thresholding the co-expression measures and defining edges between highly co-expressed genes.
4. **Module Detection**: Identify gene modules or clusters in the co-expression network using methods such as clustering or community detection algorithms.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the co-expression network and gene modules to gain insights into the gene relationships.we can export it using Cytoscape and visualize it using cytoscape, Gephi, igraph R tool.
6. **Ontology**: We do the gene ontology by using different ontology tools like gProfiller, Panther, agriGO, ShineyGO etc otherwise we can use the clueGO plugin of cytoscape for better visualization.

## Usage

To construct the co-expression network, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/abhijitswain09/Construction-of-co-expression-network.git`
2. Place the gene expression data in the appropriate input directory.
3. Install the required dependencies listed in the "Dependencies" section.
4. Modify the configuration file if necessary to specify specific parameters for the analysis.
5. Execute the network construction script: `Rscript WGCNA.R`
6. The results will be generated in the output directory.

## Results

The results of the co-expression network construction and module detection will be stored in the output directory. This will include various files such as the network adjacency matrix, module assignments, and visualization plots.
